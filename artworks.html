    <h2>"METAL ACCESSORY"</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">FASHION</p>
    <p>This project utilizes fine wires and hollow metal tubes to craft an intricate, three-dimensional accessory that embodies both structural elegance and sculptural delicacy.</p>
    <p>The creative process began with an open brainstorming session, where I aimed to design an accessory seldom encountered in everyday life. Initially, the concept of a tie emerged, and I translated this idea into a series of sketches. However, I soon realized the challenges of capturing its three-dimensional quality. This led me to shift my focus toward headwear, a form more conducive to exploring spatial structure and sculptural expression.</p>
    <div class="image-slider">

      <img src="ArtWorks照片/2nd sketch of earing.png" loading="lazy"  />
      
    </div>

    <p>After completing the initial sketch, I found that the design matched well with my original idea. To better understand how it would look in practice, I used Photoshop to visualize the piece on a model, helping me evaluate its appearance and structure more clearly.</p>

      <img src="ArtWorks照片/2nd prototypr.png" loading="lazy" >
    </div>

    <p>After completing the initial prototype, I further refined the structure by threading fine wires through the hollow metal tubes. This technique allowed me to introduce more intricate details, enhance the three-dimensional form, and achieve a better sense of balance and tension throughout the piece. Through these adjustments, the design became more expressive and aligned more closely with my original vision.</p>

    <h2>"SELF PORTRAIT"</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">VISUALS</p>

   
   <p>As an international student in America, I often struggle with questions of self-identity, which has made it difficult for me to feel a true sense of belonging anywhere. In this work, I use various memorable items from my past to reconstruct and share my personal history, shaping and affirming my sense of self.</p>

   <div class="image-slider">
    <img src="ArtWorks照片/3rd final past.png" loading="lazy" >
  </div>
   <p>For the final work, I used Adobe Illustrator to edit the composition. The background is rendered in a muted gray tone, and the patterns are intentionally blurred and vintage in style. In the background, numerous fireworks light up the scene, symbolizing unforgettable memories from my past. At the center of the image, a pattern resembling my face emerges. The river transforms into my hair, the boat becomes my ear, and the paddle shapes my eyebrow — reflecting the times I spent boating with friends near my grandmother’s house. The bicycle wheels form my eyes, another type of firework shapes my nose, and a dragon boat — a traditional vessel used in Chinese rituals — becomes my mouth. This visual approach reflects the fading nature of my memories, the impossibility of returning to the past, and a sense of disconnection from reality.
  </p>
  <p>Additions for this project</p>
  <p>In addition to the main work, I also created two more self-portraits inspired by personal reflection. One represents my “present.” In this image, I use a game machine to symbolize my current self, as playing games has become a meaningful part of my life. I also incorporate various elements that represent who I am today, arranging them into the shape of an arrow — an arrow that connects my past to my future.</p>
  <div class="image-slider">
    <img src="ArtWorks照片/3rd present.png" loading="lazy"  />
  </div>
  <p>The second piece represents my “future.” Unlike the muted tones of the previous works, this image introduces unique colors to suggest the uncertainty and possibility of the future. The tags wrapped around my arm symbolize the different careers and identities I may hold as I move forward.</p>

    <div class="image-slider">

    </div>
    <p>It is a summer night many years ago. When I left school and walked to home, my mother just stand next to my home’s gate and smiled to me, I started to think about what day was it that day, because my mother always being strict to me, she rarely smiled to me. I felt confused and asked what happened that day. My mother told me that it was my birthday, and she had a gift to me. I felt shocked because I forgot about my birthday. Then my mother passed the gift box to me, I opened it, it is a brand new iPhone. I expected this electronic devices for almost a year. I could not wait to use it. I finished pre-settings very fast, I could not wait to try some functions in the phone, because it is my first electronic device. I leant over and watched the screen of my phone. I  clicked on the camera and flipped it to take a selfie, I started to think about how to use that phone in the future, and what games I can play with my friends on my mobile phone. However, my mother told to me that I can only use this phone when I go out without them for contacting next day.</p>
    
    <p>MY GRANDPARENTS</p><div class="image-slider">
      <img src="ArtWorks照片/4th second writing.png" loading="lazy" />
    </div>
    <p>When I was a child, I lived in my grandparents’ house for 2 years, because of my mother did not have extra time to take care of me. I like to live with my grandparents, because they are kind to me. They buy food everyday and cook the dishes which I like for me. My favorite time is when I watched TV then heard my grandmother told me the dinner is ready. In a winter night, I wanted to set fireworks with my friends in front of my grand mother’s house. My mother stopped us because she said it is too dangerous for a 8-year-old kid to set fireworks with his friends. When my grandmother heard  the conversation between me and my mother, she went to the store and buy some fireworks. After that, she told me that she wanted to share a secret to me, and asked me to walked to the park. When we arrived the park, she showed us the fireworks. She even told my mother to clean the kitchen at home to extend our “happy firework time”. I still missed my grandparents a lot after I went abroad for university.</p>

    <p>MY FUTURE</p>
    <div class="image-slider">
      <img src="ArtWorks照片/4th third writing.png" loading="lazy" />
    </div>
    <p>I had two good friends in my high school, when we eat lunch together, we will talk about who we will be, and what we will do in the future. I always said I have no ideas during the conversation, because I think the future has millions of possibilities. In this summer, we decided a graduation trip. We went to Qingdao, a beautiful coastal city. We were very exited when we walked by the beach and enjoyed the sunshine. Since that we lived in inland of China, so we can only see the ocean when we traveling. The last day of the trip, we board a cruise ship and enjoyed the view from the deck. When I see seagulls flied on the sky, I think I had the answer to the question which we always talk about when we had lunch together. Future is still undecided, but my future will like the seagulls fly to the sky, bring me to a brilliant and better life.</p>

    <p>PAPER MASK</p>
    <p>I also used the paper-folding and cutting techniques I learned from my grandmother during childhood to create this paper mask. This mask represents myself, with its decorations directly connected to the elements from my three short stories.</p>

  <h2>"WIRED HEART"</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">MODELS</p>
  <p>After studying Ruth Asawa’s wire projects, I was deeply drawn to the elegance and fluidity of her work. Her ability to transform simple materials into intricate, organic forms inspired me to explore wire as a medium myself. Motivated by her approach, I used wires to create this piece, focusing on interpreting the patterns and textures of a leaf. While influenced by her techniques, I allowed the twisted wires to grow and branch out naturally, eventually shaping into the form of a heart — symbolizing the transformation of a tree’s veins into the pulse of life.
    Through this process, I was also reflecting on the relationship between nature and human activity. The industrial material of wire, originally cold and mechanical, is reshaped here to evoke natural growth and vitality, bridging the gap between the organic world and human-made constructs.</p>

  <h2>"BOOK: DEJA VU!"</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">VISUALS</p>
  <p>This project focuses on creating a book based on various idioms related to time. Inspired by my personal experiences and the familiar feeling of déjà vu that many people encounter, I developed a series of short stories. Presented in the style of a children’s picture book, these stories explore the fluidity of time through playful and nostalgic illustrations.</p>
  <p>Processes:</p>
  <p>I began by brainstorming to expand my ideas, then selected one concept to further develop. After refining the idea, I created a storyboard and selected appropriate materials. I then illustrated the stories and printed them out. Finally, I mounted the pages onto cardboard and completed the book through hand-binding.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">MODELS</p>
  <p>This is a spatial artwork created through the combination of wooden pieces and hollow metal tubes. I used wood and hollow metal tubes as the primary materials for this project. Utilizing laser cutting techniques, I crafted hollow pentagon shapes to enhance the visual appearance. I then used round-head paper fasteners to connect the pentagons and form the geometric structure. After assembling the base, I used wires to connect each hollow metal tube, creating a secondary linear structure. The concept behind the line structure is to form a star-shaped pattern when viewed from above by strategically connecting triangular forms.</p>

  <h2>"PAPER GARMENT"</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">FASHION</p>
  <p>This project explores the transformation of a flat surface into a three-dimensional garment structure through simple yet intentional interventions. I began by drawing three types of lines — dominant, subdominant, and subordinate — on a sheet of paper. Following the paths of these lines, I made precise cuts, leaving narrow openings, and then twisted and manipulated the paper before reconnecting the edges. Through this process, I created a sculptural form with a distinctive and dynamic sense of movement.

    This project also challenged me to think carefully about the relationships between line, surface, and volume. Inspired by architectural prototypes that use similar techniques — such as early paper models by Zaha Hadid and the structural experiments of Shigeru Ban — I discovered new possibilities for using paper as a material for both artistic and structural exploration. This experience broadened my understanding of how a simple sheet of paper can evolve into complex, spatial compositions.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -10px;">FASHION</p>
  <p>This is a jacket I created for my fashion studio. As a fashion editor, I would spotlight this collection for its unique blend of streetwear and Wild West culture. The story behind this piece draws inspiration from the rich, rebellious spirit of the American Old West — a world marked by danger and defiance. Reimagining the classic denim jacket with authentic old-west patches, the design feels like a journey through time, merging historical influences with modern street style to create a fresh and dynamic expression.</p>
